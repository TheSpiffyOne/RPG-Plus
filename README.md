## ❓FAQ
<ul>
<li>Q: How Do I play with this Modpack?
    
**A:** You have to install the Modrinth Launcher and download the pack there</li>

<li>Q: I have an issue where can I get help?
    
**A:** Join our linked Discord and visit the #help-required thread</li>

<li>Q: My World is loading slow why?

**A:** There are over 156 mods, they all require to be loaded + Distant Horizons takes some time to load, so please be patient</li>

<li>Q: I want to add a different shader, how do I do that?

**A:** Distant Horizons requires compatible shaders which are included in the pack, if you want a different shader that isn't included in the Modpack, you will have to find one that is compatible and add it yourself</li>

<li>Q: Why is my game Low FPS?

**A:** This might be due to your Java memory limit, which you can change in Modrinth (the default is very low, change it based on the amount of RAM you have). You can also tweak Distant Horizons and the Shader (if you have one turned on) settings to be less intensive on your computer</li>

<li>Q: Where do you get all these mods/are they official or modified?

**A:** All of the mods, resource packs, shaders are from Modrinth or CurseForge Official Sources. I do not modify any of the items I add to the Modpack, I am simply creating a Modpack of existing content posted by the amazing Creators</li>
</ul>
